{"ingredients": ["2 (12 ounce) packages egg roll wrappers", "1 (27 ounce) can whole green chiles - seeded, drained well, and patted dry", "1 pound Monterey Jack cheese, cut into 3x1/2-inch thick strips", "vegetable oil for frying"], "recipe": ["Lay a wrapper on a work surface diagonally so it resembles a diamond. Place a slice of green chile horizontally across the wrapper, 1 inch above the bottom point. Place a strip of Monterey Jack cheese on top of the chile.", "Fill a small bowl with water. Dip an index finger into the water and moisten the edges of the wrapper. Roll the wrapper up and over the chile and cheese, starting from the point closest to you. Bring in both sides, making sure to press firmly to seal the filling. Roll away from you and to enclose the yumminess inside. Repeat with remaining wrappers, chiles, and Monterey Jack cheese.", "Heat approximately 1/2 inch of oil in a deep frying pan over medium heat. Carefully lay a few egg rolls into the hot oil. Fry, turning once, until golden brown on both sides, 2 to 3 minutes. Watch carefully to prevent burning. Repeat with remaining egg rolls.", "Transfer fried egg rolls to a plate lined with paper towels and let cool for a few minutes before serving."]}
