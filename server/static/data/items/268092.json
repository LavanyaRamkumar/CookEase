{"ingredients": ["1 large zucchini, sliced", "cooking spray", "1 (1 ounce) package taco seasoning mix", "2 tablespoons sliced black olives", "2 tablespoons chopped red onion", "8 slices pickled jalapeno pepper", "1 cup shredded Cheddar cheese"], "recipe": ["Trim ends of zucchini; use a mandoline on the thinnest setting to cut zucchini into 1/8-inch slices. Place slices on a plate lined with paper towels, top with additional paper towels, and press down to remove excess moisture.", "Place zucchini slices on a cutting board and lightly mist with cooking spray. Turn slices over and sprinkle with taco seasoning; lightly mist this side with cooking spray as well. Place slices seasoned-side up on a microwave-safe plate, making sure none are overlapping. Cook in the microwave on high power for 2 minutes and 30 seconds. Carefully flip slices over and cook 30 seconds more. Repeat with remaining zucchini.", "Divide chips between 2 microwave-safe plates. Add black olives, red onion, jalapeno peppers, and Cheddar cheese. Microwave on high power until cheese is melted, about 30 seconds."]}
