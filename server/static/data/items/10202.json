Using a little flour, if needed, roll between your hands to form pencil shapes.", "Cut into 1/4 inch pieces.  Place each on floured cloth. In a large pan on top of the stove, heat oil to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C).  Deep-fry pieces about 1/2 cup at a time, turning constantly until golden.  Drain and set aside.  (Note:  after several batches, dough begins to turn brown quickly.  This means it is time to change the oil)", "In large pan, bring honey to boil with vanilla bean.  Discard bean.
