{"ingredients": ["cooking spray", "1/4 cup fresh lemon juice", "1 (.25 ounce) envelope unflavored gelatin", "2 cups heavy whipping cream", "1 cup half-and-half", "2 teaspoons fresh lemon zest, plus more for garnish", "1/3 cup granulated sugar", "1/2 teaspoon vanilla extract", "6 leaves fresh mint"], "recipe": ["Lightly oil or spray six 6 ounce ramekins.", "Pour lemon juice in a small bowl and sprinkle with gelatin. Let sit for 5 minutes to soften the gelatin; mix well. Set aside.", "Stir together heavy cream, half and half, and lemon zest in a saucepan over low heat. Add sugar, stirring frequently, until sugar has dissolved completely. Heat mixture slowly until it just about to boil, about 15 minutes. Remove from heat.", "Whisk gelatin mixture and vanilla extract into the cream mixture until well blended and gelatin is completely dissolved. Keep lightly whisking until the mixture comes close to room temperature, about 10 minutes. This will prevent the gelatin and cream from separating while the panna cotta is setting.", "Divide mixture into ramekins, about 1/2 cup per portion. Cover each ramekin with plastic wrap and refrigerate until set, about 4 hours.", "Run a knife around the inside edges of the ramekin to remove panna cotta from the ramekins. Carefully dip each ramekin into a bowl of hot water for a few seconds. Carefully invert onto serving plates, tap, and jiggle the ramekin a bit if needed for the panna cotta to come loose. Garnish with additional lemon zest and mint leaves, and serve with fresh blueberries."]}
